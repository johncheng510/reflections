When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when it is desired to work on the repository with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- you don't want Git to automatically overwrite something you're working on locally with something on the remote repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks clone repositories between GitHub accounts. Clones clone either remote or local repositories to the local machine. Branches are created on local machines.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- This would be beneficial for continuing to work on the remote copy when you don't have an internet conneciton.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- I might use Dropbox or Google Drive. Easier for collaborators who don't know how to use Git or GitHub, harder for doing version control.
