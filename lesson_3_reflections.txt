When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when it is desired to work on the repository with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- you don't want Git to automatically overwrite something you're working on locally with something on the remote repository
