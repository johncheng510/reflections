What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Initializing a repository creates a folder called ".git" in the working directory. Files placed in the .git folder can then be tracked with commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- Staging area is the middle ground that collects files from the working directory for potential addition to the repository. The staging area can serve as a temporary holding pen to decide what files to add to the repository.
