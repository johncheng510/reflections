How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It allowed me to quickly scan for differences between the two files without having to compare every line of code in a time-consuming way.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could easily find various versions I've worked on if I want to retrieve something from an earlier version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I can decide when to do a commit
    Cons: I might forget to do a commit when one is needed

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git helps users save multiple files that are dependent on one another.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the history of commits
    git diff shows the additions and deletions between two different commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I would be reassured that I could always retrieve the version before the mistake.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Uploading projects to GitHub
